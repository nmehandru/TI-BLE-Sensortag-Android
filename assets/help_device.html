		<p>When the view is started a <b>Service Discovery</b> is initiated. This may take up to ten seconds depending on the
		number of services the device offers. When <b>Service Discovery</b> is completed, all <b>GATT services</b> are listed. 
		The details displayed are the UUID and number of characteristics. Additionally the service name will be shown, providing it is a 
		service defined by <b>Bluetooth Sig</b> or is a service from TI's <b>SensorTag</b> or <b>Simple BLE Peripheral</b> applications. 
		Click on one of the listed services to view and operate its <b>GATT characteristics</b></p>.
